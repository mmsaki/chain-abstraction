- [ ] Tenderly
  - Your README documents a functionality that we can try out (written or video), stressing the way
  - Your dapp is runnable. When we run the dapp and execute a functionality, we expect to see corresponding JSON RPC calls to the testnet.
  - Provide shell scripts that deploy your contracts to the Virtual TestNet, if you deploy contracts.
  - Your hack dazzles us with an innovative use of Virtual TestNets
  - Deploy smart contracts to the Virtual TestNet and integrate at least one off-chain component\* with a Virtual TestNet.
- [ ] Thirdweb
  - Deploy contracts with thirdweb
- [ ] Custom chain with conduit
  - Bridge tokens to a different chain
- [ ] Superform
  - Tokenized vault
- [ ] Alchemy
  - To qualify, this submission must be a React application using Alchemy Embedded Accounts
  - including the UI React Components ("@account-kit/react")
  - [Get Started](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/accounts) either Light Account or Modular Account
- [ ] Farcaster
  - The Farcaster Frame must be live in production to qualify and actions must trigger contract interactions onchain.
  - The onchain interactions must be on one of the Superchain ecosystem networks.
  - [ ] Turn your search component into a farcaster frame
    - [Farcaster tutorial](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/developers/frames/getting-started)
    - [Frog Platforms deploy another way](https://frog.fm/platforms/bun)
- [ ] Chainlink CCIP
  - You want to send cross-chain message from blockchain A to blockchain B without worrying if the lane between them exists.
  - [Documentation](https://docs.chain.link/ccip)
  - Build something awesome using Chainlink CCIP on Optimism or Base!
  - Each project must use Chainlink CCIP in some form to make a state change on a blockchain, otherwise it will not be eligible for the Chainlink core prizes.
- [ ] Blockscout
  - We have a REST API, GraphQL, and standardized RPC API endpoints available for use - no key required!
  - Verify your smart contract(s) using Blockscout manually with the Blockscout UI, via API, or with tools like Hardhat or Foundry.
  - Show Blockscout in your presentation - how you used it with your project and when checking any resulting transactions.
  - Prepare and submit your DApp which includes Blockscout links to the DAppscout marketplace.
- [ ] Mode
  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is here to change a lot of industries, and at Mode we want to see creative uses of AI mixed with DeFi.
  - The AI implemented can also be integrated as a learning algorithm for your project.
  - Best AI: The contracts need to be deployed on Mode testnet or mainnet. If the app is multchain, Mode needs to be included and should make sense to have Mode in the list.
  - 🎨 Best UX/UI: Ease of Use: Ensure the interface is intuitive and easy to navigate.
  - The app needs to be deployed on Mode (it's smart contracts),
- [ ] Fraxtal
  - Deployment of the contracts on Fraxtal Mainnet and UI
  - Any applications/protocols that are deployed to Fraxtal mainnet with its token issued on Fraxtal are eligible for prizes.
- [ ] Conduit
  - We're awarding $10k in prizes to the 3 best OP Stack chains deployed on Conduit during Superhack 2024!
  - Use Pyth Entropy to generate and consume random number on chains.
  - Most Innovative use of Pyth pull oracle
    - Use Pyth pull oracle to power up you dapp.
    - Your app should use Pyth price feeds via Pull method.
      1. [Pull/Fetch the data from Hermes](https://ethglob.al/imnqw)
      1. Update the data on chain
      1. Consume the price
    - Please follow our comprehensive [Pyth EVM guide](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/use-real-time-data/evm) to to integrate Pyth in less than 5 minutes
- [ ] EAS
  - It must generate attestations using existing or new schemas.
  - It’s a problem worth solving with blockchain that's better than existing systems and experiences.
  - Use the EAS contracts on Base or Optimism.
- [ ] Celo
  - Deploy on our new Cel2
    - Deploy your dApp on Alfajores and on Dango (Testnet)
    - Provide feedback on your development experience by filling out our feedback form
  - Use the Celo-Composer Starter Kit MiniPay template to have the correct setup
  - Deploy your contracts on Celo Alfajores Testnet or Celo Mainnet
  - Build a responsive web app that can be demoed within the MiniPay Site Tester
  - use viem or wagmi in the FE for interacting with smart contracts
  - Examples:
    - Utility: what APIs can you integrate to pay for everyday use cases, e.g., BitGifty
    - Personal Finance: Savings dApp focused on stablecoins. What makes your dapp especially useful, and attractive? Check out existing successful savings apps and dapps and understand how you can bring that to MiniPay.
- [ ] WorldCoin
  - Integrate Sign in with World ID or Incognito Actions
  - World ID must be fully integrated. Proof validation is required and needs to occur in a web backend or smart contract.
  - Gas Subsidy with World ID & Reth
