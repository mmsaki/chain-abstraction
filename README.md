# Chain Abstraction

Praject Name: **Siera** - An explorer for the Superchain with ERC3770 Chain-specific Addresses Search and support for ERC7683 Chain Abstraction transfer.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies

```sh
bun install
```

## Run Test

```sh
bun test
```

## Smart Account Address

Let's run this code with npm.

```sh
bun run smartAccountAddress
```

You should see the smart account address printed to the console.

```sh
Smart account address: https://{chain}.blockscout.com/address/{address}
```

If the request times out but the `pimlico.js` file has already been compiled to `pimlico.js`

```sh
node dist/pimlico.js
```

## Start Project

Run this to start a server at `http://localhost:3000`

```sh
bun run dev
```

Create deployment build

```sh
bun run build
```

## Features

- Our goal provide transfer routing between multiple L2 - L2 transfers with ERC7683 support that exclusively uses ERC3770 chain-specific address for searching address and creating transfers.
- We extend this concept by also deploying a L3 on top of Mode L2. This is a perfect usecase for the need for readable ERC3770 address and using ERC7683 standards for token transfers.
- We provide a simple search tool and use demonstrated with MetalL2 search address.
- Using API from Across protocol we obtain many more tokens transfers routes between OPStack chains including those routing to L1.
- We support log in with passkeys.
- We also attempt use Farcaster for Log in - https://siera.cc/account
- This superhack attempts to also combine account abstraction and chain abstraction in addition to the ERC3770 and ERC7683 work.
- We also used Blockscout to verify contract of our L3 Gas Token on Mode Sepolia.
